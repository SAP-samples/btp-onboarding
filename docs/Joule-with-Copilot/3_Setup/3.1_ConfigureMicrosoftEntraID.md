## Configure Redirect URIs

In case the Entitlements are not found in your SAP BTP Global Account, and if the order is processed, it could be that you have Multiple SAP BTP Global Accounts, and the license could have been assigned to the other account. Please reach the SAP BTP CSM or AE for support.
