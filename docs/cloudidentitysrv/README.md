**Getting Started with your SAP BTP Default Identity Provider / SAP Cloud Identity Service Provider (SAP IdP)**

**Use Case:** 

Your organization has started with the SAP Business Technology Platform and has plans to develop applications, integrations, automation, analytics, and several other use cases that are required. You may be at a very early stage of setting up your account models, understanding role collections to provide access to the developers, and assigning admin roles, and towards the end you may want to provide access to your business end users for consumption. It is always a good practice to consider the Security services during the planning stage and think about the options for authentication and authorization of your users based on the roles that are assigned.  

Security is a huge topic and it should be considered for all stages. However, this mission is geared towards exploring and getting you started with the SAP BTP Identity Service which can help you achieve Identity Authentication and Identity Authorization services. We will focus on the differences between your BTP Default Identity Providers vs Custom Identity Providers, and how to manage user access via the Custom IdP for your BTP Services for your developers and your end users.  

**What are the prerequisites to access SAP Cloud Identity Services?**

You need to have an SAP BTP Enterprise Account which can be PAYG, CPEA, or Subscription license along with SAP Global Account Administrator Role to activate the Identity services. We shall also look into more details, in the mission in case you have existing Cloud Identity Services.  

**What is the outcome of this mission?**

You can start with the best practices and recommendations on user access and provisioning at an early stage to gain maximum benefits and safeguard your cloud access.
