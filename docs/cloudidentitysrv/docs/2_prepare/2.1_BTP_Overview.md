## SAP BTP Cockpit Overview 

As you begin your journey with SAP BTP Security concepts (Default Identity Providers or Cloud Identity Services), we aim to make this mission easier for new customers to get started.  

If you recently purchased an SAP BTP enterprise license, you could check out our mission  “[Get Started with SAP BTP Enterprise Account](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/3019/3016/)” and you may visit [SAP Business Technology Platform Onboarding Resource Center](https://support.sap.com/en/product/onboarding-resource-center/business-technology-platform.html).  

Note: There are various ways to approach security topics. Specifically, SAP Cloud Identity Services could have been provisioned to you via multiple SAP Cloud licenses, for example, SAP SuccessFactors. Throughout this mission, your primary focus is on security related to the SAP Business Technology Platform.  

Here, you are setting up a new SAP BTP account for a new customer, and we require access to the SAP BTP Account as a Global Account Administrator.

In the previous sections, we also shared the details on how to identify any existing Cloud Identity Services for your company. If you have the service up and running, you may use the existing service and move to the next step.
