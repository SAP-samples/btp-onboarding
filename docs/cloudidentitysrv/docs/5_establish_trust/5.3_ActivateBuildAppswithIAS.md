## Activate SAP Build Apps with Cloud Identity Services 

In this exercise, you will activate the SAP Build Services. As a prerequisite, you also need to have activated SAP Cloud Identity Services, which we completed in the previous exercise. As part of the standard approach for activating the service, you need to add entitlements and activate them. 

Ensure you have fulfilled the prerequisites from [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-apps/service-guide/prerequisites).

You have 2 options to activate the services. 

Run the Booster - [Get Started with SAP Build Apps](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-apps/service-guide/booster-automatic-configuration) 

OR 

Run it via the [Manual Configuration](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-apps/service-guide/manual-configuration) 

For the final setup of Cloud Identity Services to be used with Build Apps, you need to [Configure the User Role](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-apps/service-guide/configuring-user-roles). 

Once the configuration is completed, you may test by adding new users to the Customer IDP.  

This completes our general getting-started mission and gets you comfortable with SAP Cloud Identity Services.
