## Activate SAP Business Application Studio 

As discussed in the previous section, we shall work with SAP Business Application Studio, the Default Identity Provider, and assign the required roles to get access.  

**Add entitlements to your BTP subaccount** 

To set up access to SAP Business Application Studio, we need to add the entitlements to these services to the subaccount. 

Note: We are using the existing subaccounts that we created for activating the IAS tenants in the previous sections. Based on your project plan, you may prefer to create a subaccount based on service availability. Please refer to Data Center availability in the [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/business-application-studio).  

- Log in to your SAP BTP Global Account. Navigate to your subaccount.  

- Assign the entitlements for SAP Business Application Studio and SAP Build Work Zone (standard edition) to your subaccount. To do this, click on **Entitlements** -> Click on **Configure Entitlements**, and then click on **Add Service Plans**. A new window should pop up.

- Select the service, **SAP Business Application Studio, standard-edition (Application)** service plan. If you are evaluating SAP Business Application Studio, choose the **free (Application)** or **trial (Application)** service plan as applicable. Then, click **Add 1 Service Plan** and save the settings.  

In our scenario, I have selected a productive license, which will be charged according to my license plan.

- You will see a new pop-up window – Creation in Progress. Click on **View Subscription** to navigate to **Instances and Subscriptions**. The SAP Business Application Studio service is displayed with the status **Subscribed**.

- Once the status of the service is **Subscribed**, it is available for development. Every service that we activate in SAP BTP creates new roles to support the administrative tasks.

- For SAP BAS, you have 3 roles that get automatically generated and listed in the role's sections. Until these roles are assigned, we will not be able to access the service. If you attempt to access it, you will encounter an 'Access Denied' error.  

The following is on the screen without assigning any roles.

**Role Assignment using Default IDP** 

Navigate to the Security option and select **Role Collections**, and search for “**Business_Application_Studio**”. You should be able to see 3 roles that are created upon activation of BAS, and they should be assigned to the user to access the BAS Studio.

<br>
<p align="center" <b>Image 8</b> </p>

Now, let us go ahead and assign the roles to the User. Click on **Users** -> select the user that you would like to assign the roles -> click on the Additional Options (3 dots) and select **Assign Role Collection** -> Select the roles required for the user and save the settings.

Now the user should be able to access the Business Application Studio.

Note that in this setup, you have not used a Custom Identity Provider or the SAP Cloud Identity Services. Users are still authenticated via the SAP Default Identity Provider and the roles assigned to them.
