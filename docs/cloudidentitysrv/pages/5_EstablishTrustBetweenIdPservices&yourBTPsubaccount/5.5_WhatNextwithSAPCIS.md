## What's Next with SAP Cloud Identity Services? 

We are just getting started with SAP Security services and our mission was an introduction to the huge world of security. There could be many questions likes: 

How can I make use of my existing IAM or Active Directory services to connect with BTP? 

Can I set up an SSO, Principal Propagation, Two Factor Authentication, SMS Based authentication, how does it help in my application development, and many more  

You may want to plan your Security activities as per your project requirements. To assist, here are some of the help documents for advanced settings:
