## Activate SAP Build Apps with Cloud Identity Services 

In this exercise, we will be activating the SAP Build Services and as a pre-requisite, we also need SAP Cloud Identity Services which we have already activated in the previous exercise. As part of the standard approach to activate the service, we need to add entitlements and activate them. To achieve this, we have our SAP Help guides with updated content giving us options to activate the services in 2 ways, ensure we have [pre-requisites](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-apps/service-guide/prerequisites) and then: 

Run the Booster - [Get Started with SAP Build Apps](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-apps/service-guide/booster-automatic-configuration) 

OR 

Run it via the [Manual Configuration](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-apps/service-guide/manual-configuration) 

For the final setup of Cloud Identity Services to be used with Build Apps, we need to [Configure the User Role](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-apps/service-guide/configuring-user-roles). 

Once the configuration is completed, you may test by adding new users to the Customer IDP.  

This completes our general getting started mission and gets you comfortable with SAP Cloud Identity Services.
