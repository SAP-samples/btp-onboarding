## Final Setup and Testing Scenario 

In the previous section we learnt about different approaches to working with user authentication approaches and understood about the SAP Cloud Identity Services. Now, it is equally important to understand how to configure them with your SAP BTP Subaccounts and start using them. While activating this service we will demonstrate on using Default Identity Provider and to explore the IAS services we will explore the service: 

- SAP Build Apps, available as Free Tier and IAS is mandatory service  

During this process we will explore the option to set up the trust between your Subaccount and the Custom Identity Provider. We will understand the setup of trust in two options: 

- Configure SAML 2.0 Service Provider 
- Configure OpenID Connect Application
