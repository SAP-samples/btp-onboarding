## Adding users to Default Identity Provider 

With initial access to the SAP BTP Cockpit as a Global Account Administrator, it is your responsibility to manage the SAP BTP Global Account. We recommend adding a secondary global account administrator in case of emergency or sharing your workload within your organization.  

To add, click on **Security** -> **Users** -> click on **Create** and enter your **Email Address** in the **User Name** section and the **E-Mail** section. The **Identity Provider** will be the **default identity provider** as we have not activated any custom SAP Cloud Identity Services in the system yet. Click on Create once the details are entered.

Once the User is created, expand the selection and click on **Additional Options **(the three dots) and select **Assign Role Collection**, now select the role â€“ **Global Account Administrator** and click on **Assign Role Collection**.
