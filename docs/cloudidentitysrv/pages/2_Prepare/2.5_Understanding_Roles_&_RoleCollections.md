## Understanding the [Roles and Role Collections](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/roles-and-role-collections)

**Roles** 

Users require authorizations to perform tasks within SAP BTP. Service-specific roles show up in your SAP BTP cockpit for assignment after a service is activated. For example, activating SAP Business Application Studio, Workzone, Build Services, etc. will make the subsequent access roles available.  

**Role Collections** 

Role Collections are one or a group of roles that can be created from scratch or copied that are created by the SAP BTP Services. These role collections help to group roles and assign them to users easily. Similar role collections are created for both the roles of Global Account Administrator and Global Account Viewer.  

First, let us look at the Global Roles created by default while provisioning your Global Account. Navigate to **Security** -> click on **Role Collections**.

For a Global Account Administrator there are [4 different Roles](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/role-collections-and-roles-in-global-accounts-directories-and-subaccounts?q=System%20Landscape%20Administrator%20) have been grouped: 

| Role Name  | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Global Account Admin | Includes read-write authorizations for updating the global account, setting entitlements, and creating, updating, and deleting subaccounts. |
| Global Account Usage Reporting Viewer | Includes read-only authorizations for viewing global account usage information.|
| System Landscape Administrator | Includes read-write authorizations for registering SAP systems and assigning SAP systems to formations.|
| User and Role Administrator | Includes read-write authorizations for trusted identity providers, role collections, roles, and users.|

As an organization, you may decide to give all these roles to one user, or you may decide to assign a security expert only to manage **User and Role Administration** or a **System Landscape Administrator** role for an integration expert.   

### Assigning – “User and Role Administrator Role” 

Let us take the example to assign a user only a few roles, for example, to manage only the **User and Role Administrator**. This role is created by default, to achieve this requirement we need to create a role collection.  

Within your BTP Global Account, click on **Security** -> click on **Role Collection** -> Click on Create “**New Role Collection**” and enter the Name & Description as “**User and Role Administrator**” and click on Create.

<p align="center" <b>Image 2</b> </p>

Now the Role Collection is created, remember we are yet to assign a Role. Expand the role collection **User and Role Administrator** -> click on **Edit**.

Now click on the Role Name selection window, select the role **User and Role Administrator**, and click on **Add** -> **Save** the settings.

Tip: Many Roles are created by default by the BTP account, we recommend looking at each of these roles. More information about the default roles for the BTP Global Account cockpit can be found [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/role-collections-and-roles-in-global-accounts-directories-and-subaccounts?q=System%20Landscape%20Administrator%20).  

Now, we have created a new role collection, let us assign this to a new user. Create a new user by navigating to **Security** -> **Users** -> **Create** -> Enter the email address in **User Name** and **E-Mail** and click on **Create**.  

Expand the new user that you created and click on **Assign Role Collection** -> select the role “**User and Role Administrator**” and click on **Assign Role Collection**.

<br>
<p align="center" <b>Image 5</b> </p>

Now you may request the new user that you have created to log in. In my case, I have created a new user to my secondary email address and assigned the role – **User and Role Administration**. As detailed above this will only allow the user to Create or Manage the user roles and other access to BTP Global Account is completely restricted as shown below.

A similar approach can be considered with your Default Identity Provider for Directory roles, Subaccount Roles, etc...
