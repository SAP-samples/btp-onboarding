## Welcome and Target Group for this Mission 

Welcome to the SAP Discovery Center mission – **“Getting Started with your SAP BTP Default Identity Provider and SAP Cloud Identity Service Provider (SAP IdP)”!**

### About this Mission

This mission is designed to get you started on the SAP Security topic with BTP. As part of your SAP BTP purchase, SAP provides a Default Identity Provider at no additional charge for the purposes of supporting **Authentication** and **Authorization** requirements for both platform and business user management.  

Additionally, **SAP Cloud Identity Services** helps to integrate **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** between systems and establish Single Sign On across your systems, taking care of the **Authentication**, **Authorizations**, and **Provisioning** of users within your SAP BTP Enterprise Account. 

In case you do not yet have an **SAP BTP Enterprise Account** and if you wish to explore/SAP BTP services, you may purchase a [Pay-As-You-Go](https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-9999951781_live_v1/sap-business-technology-platform) license for your POCs.  

Note: SAP BTP Services could incur charges. Please refer to the Service Catalog in the SAP Discovery Center for more information, you can leverage the ‘Free and Always Free’ filter to see which services are offered in a free capacity. To get started on the right path with your SAP BTP Enterprise account we recommend attending a [SAP BTP Onboarding](https://support.sap.com/en/product/onboarding-resource-center/business-technology-platform.html) webinar or visiting the [SAP BTP Onboarding Resource Center](https://support.sap.com/en/product/onboarding-resource-center/business-technology-platform.html).
