## Deleting your SAP Cloud Identity Services - Optional 

In a few cases, if you decide that you have created the IAS tenant and no longer wish to use them, you can go ahead and delete the service.  

Note: Only a subaccount administrator has the authorization to delete the services.  

Before you delete, ensure that the services are not linked to other subaccounts before deleting them. If you have any users in the tenant, please take a backup of the users, roles, and any essential information.  

To delete the services, you can navigate to your **Subaccount** -> click on **Services** -> click on **Instances and Subscriptions** -> look for **SAP Cloud Identity Services** and click on the **Actions** (3 dots) button and select **Delete** (Note: If you delete your tenant all data will be lost and there are no recovery options).
