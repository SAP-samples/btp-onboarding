  - Change the display name of your Global Account
  - Check your Entitlements for the Global Account



### Prepare Your E-Mails

#### Check your first mail: IT Contact for your SAP BTP tenant

Once your account is ready to be provisioned, SAP (no.reply.provisioning@sap.com) will sent you a "User Registration & Onboarding" e-mail. The e-mail contains the information you need to access your Global Account. 

>**Note:** This mail is sent to the IT Contact person of your company, whose ID was provided during the contract signing process. The initial SAP BTP Global Account access is provided only to the IT Contact, and it is their responsibility to add additional Global Administrators and delegate work as required. 

If you are not the IT Contact person and have received the BTP login details from your Administrator, you can proceed to the next steps.

The User Registration & Onboarding e-mail contains a button labeled "Activate my S-User Identity". Click the button and follow the instructions. 

For more information, see the [S-User Welcome Page](https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/users/welcome.html).

#### Check your second mail: Access Information for your SAP BTP tenant


You will receive your second e-mail from "System & Provisioning" shortly after the first e-mail.

The S-user of the Global Account Administrator is attached to your SAP BTP Global Account and your entitlements from your consumption or subscription license. You must log in with the correct URL and S-User to receive the proper entitlements.

If you are working with multiple SAP solutions, you may want to verify your assigned SAP S-Users (you may have more than one) independently of SAP BTP using the [SAP ID Service](https://accounts.sap.com/).

>**Note:** For the first login to SAP BTP Enterprise Accounts, it is essential to log on with the Global Account Administrator credentials that you received in your e-mail. If you are not an administrator, the best option is to contact your administrator to request access.
