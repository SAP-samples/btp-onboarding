### Using SAP ONE Support Launchpad or SAP for Me

To create a support ticket in SAP ONE Support Launchpad, you need an S-User.

As an S-User, you can create an additional S-User to support you. Use the User Management in [SAP ONE Support Launchpad](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/) or [SAP for Me](https://me.sap.com/servicessupport) to create and delete user IDs for new employees and assign them the required authorizations.
