# Joule provisioning for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition (PCE) using Cloud Integration Automation service

JJoule integration with **SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition** is now available as an **integration scenario in the Cloud Integration Automation service**. This replaces a complex manual setup that could take **weeks** with a guided, role-based automated workflow that can reduce setup time to **just a few days**. Customers can use the service **within SAP BTP at no additional cost** to automate key integration steps, making the overall process **faster, simpler, and more reliable**.


## Involved components

- SAP BTP
- SAP Cloud Connector
- SAP S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition (PCE)
- SAP Cloud Identity Services

## Why Cloud Integration Automation service fits this scenario

- AI-enabled task orchestration tool
- Standardized guided workflows with role-based execution
- Integrated parameter management
- Hybrid approach (automate what can be automated, generate documentation for the rest)
- Included with SAP BTP (no additional cost)
- Can surface system landscape information for better visibility
