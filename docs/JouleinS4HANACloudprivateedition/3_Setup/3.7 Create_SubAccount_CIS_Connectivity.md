# Why Cloud Identity Service Connectivity Plan & Destinations Must Be Created in a Separate Subaccount

In SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), connectivity services and destinations are scoped at the **subaccount level**.

A key limitation is:

> **One SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant can be connected to only one Connectivity plan.**

---

## What This Means

- The Connectivity plan is assigned to **a single subaccount**.
- Identity Provisioning can access only the connectivity configuration of that specific subaccount.
- Connectivity plans **cannot be shared across multiple subaccounts**.
- If a destination is created in a different subaccount, Identity Provisioning will **not** be able to see or use it.

---

## Why Use a Separate Subaccount?

Creating a dedicated subaccount for:

- Connectivity service  
- Cloud Connector  
- Destinations (e.g., for Identity Provisioning integration)  

ensures:

1. Compliance with the **one connectivity plan per tenant** restriction  
2. Proper visibility of destinations  
3. Better security isolation  
4. Clear separation between connectivity and application environments (Dev/Test/Prod)

---

## Summary

Because a Cloud Identity Services tenant supports only **one Connectivity plan**, and connectivity is scoped at the subaccount level, the Connectivity service and related destinations must be created in the **designated subaccount** linked to the Identity Services tenant.
