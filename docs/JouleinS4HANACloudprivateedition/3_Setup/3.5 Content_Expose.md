### 3. Select Roles to Expose

You can choose from the following options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **All roles with launchpad content** | Default option. All roles are exposed. |
| **Selected roles in areas** | Select specific roles or group roles by areas. See *Select Roles for Content Exposure*. |

> ℹ️ **Note**:  
> - All roles from all selected areas are used in the exposure.  
> - To **add roles**, include them in the role selection and execute the exposure again.  
> - To **remove roles**, exclude them from the role selection and re-execute the exposure.

> ⚠️ **Important**:  
> **Derived roles** are not supported directly.  
> To expose a derived role, select the **leading role** (the one that contains the launchpad content). The derived role will be exposed indirectly via its relation to the leading role.
