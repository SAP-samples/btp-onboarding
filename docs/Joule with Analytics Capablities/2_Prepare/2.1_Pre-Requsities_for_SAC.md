Before you can activate Joule, there are certain number of prerequisites that must be met. This section describes those prerequisites and outlines some details that need to be captured prior to running through the activation steps. 

## User Personas Required for Joule activation in SAC
Activation of Joule requires configuration in multiple systems. It's important to have the right stakeholders involved when setting up the configuration. To set up Joule, the following user personas are required in Analytics Cloud: 

<li>You must have a single SAP Analytics Cloud tenant with at least two free OAuth client slots available. You can find the information in your SAC by going to <b>System -> Administration -> App Integration</b> and checking the <b>Configured Clients </b> section. If you see the “<b>+ Add a New OAuth Client</b>” button, then the prerequisites are fulfilled </li>
