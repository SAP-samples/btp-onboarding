It’s important to know your landscape and how you would like to activate Analytical Insights in Joule. 



In the current release of Analytical Pattern in Joule, at least one existing Joule setup is required with any line of business (LoB), such as <b>SAP SuccessFactors, SAP S/4HANA Cloud, or SAP Build Work Zone</b>. Joule can also be used in stand-alone mode. 

<b>Please note that Joule is not currently available in your SAP Analytics Cloud tenant; this functionality is on our roadmap.</b>

We have found that SAP customers already have Joule activated in most cases; therefore, we will address both options.
