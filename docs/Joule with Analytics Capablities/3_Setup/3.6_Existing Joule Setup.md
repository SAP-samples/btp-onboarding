In this section, we will show you how to activate analytical insights in the context of an existing Joule formation.
Within your SAP BTP Global Account, navigate to <b>System Landscapes</b>, click on <b>Formations</b>, and search for the Joule formation you have already set up. In my case, I am using one of the existing formations, which has multiple SAP products connected to one Joule instance, as shown below. You can click on <b>Include System</b>.

The process may take 5 to 8 minutes to complete, and you should be able to see the synchronizing option, as shown below.

Once the status turns green and Ready, we are good to use Joule with Analytics capabilities.
