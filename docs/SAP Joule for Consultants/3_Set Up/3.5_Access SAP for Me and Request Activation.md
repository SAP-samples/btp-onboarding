## Access SAP for Me and Request Activation
 
As part of the Joule for Consultants activation process, you will need to create an SAP Incident to create the License Group in the SAP Cloud Identity Services. This process will be automated soon by SAP to avoid the ticketing process; however, at this release, this step must be completed manually.
 
To log in to SAP for Me, you will need your SAP S-User ID with Cloud Administrator authorization.
 
To activate the package, please [create a ticket](https://me.sap.com/createIssue/0) using the support component CBC-AIX and include the following information:
<li>URL of the SAP Cloud Identity tenant
<li>PUPM package: SAP Joule for Consultants
 
**Note:**
Admins should anticipate some processing time while the CBC team completes the request.
 
## Assign users to access Joule for Consultants

**Note:**
Ensure the ticket has been processed from the previous step before completing this step.
