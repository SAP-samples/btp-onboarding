## Access SAP for Me and Request Activation
 
As part of the Joule for Consultants activation process, you will need to create an SAP Incident to create the User Groups in the SAP Cloud Identity Services. This process will be automated soon by SAP to avoid the ticketing process; however, at this release, you may have to do this manually.
 
While creating the SAP Incident, ensure you provide the SAP Cloud Identity service details along with the request.

**Note:**
Contact your designated SAP technical representative to support the activation of SAP Joule for Consultants, as this step must currently be completed manually.
 
To log in to SAP for Me, you will need your SAP S-User ID with Cloud Administrator authorization.
 
<li>Go to SAP for Me(https://me.sap.com/home) → Portfolio & Products → Business AI 
<li>Create a support ticket requesting activation of SAP Joule for Consultants  
 
**Note:**
Admins should anticipate some processing time while the CBC team completes the request.
