## Access SAP for Me and Request Activation
 
As part of the Joule for Consultants activation process, you will need to create an SAP Incident to create the License Group in the SAP Cloud Identity Services. This process will be automated soon by SAP to avoid the ticketing process; however, at this release, this step must be completed manually.
 
To log in to SAP for Me, you will need your SAP S-User ID with Cloud Administrator authorization.
 
To activate the package, please create a ticket (https://me.sap.com/createIssue/0) using the support component CBC-AIX and include the following information:
<li>URL of the SAP Cloud Identity tenant
<li>PUPM package: SAP Joule for Consultants
 
**Note:**
Admins should anticipate some processing time while the CBC team completes the request.
 
## Assigning users to access Joule for Consultants

**Note:**
Ensure the ticket has been processed from the previous step before completing this step.
<br>
<li>Once the ticket is processed, the <b>SAP_JOULE_PREMIUM_CONSULTANT</b> License Group will be created in your SAP Cloud Identity Services. You can log in to SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to <b>Users & Authorization</b> -> click on <b>Groups</b> to see the group shown below.

<b>Note: </b> Currently, the automatic mapping of the SAP Cloud Identity Services group SAP_JOULE_PREMIUM_CONSULTANT to the shadow user in the BTP is not functioning correctly.
<li>As a workaround, please add the users to the BTP role collection you created earlier.
