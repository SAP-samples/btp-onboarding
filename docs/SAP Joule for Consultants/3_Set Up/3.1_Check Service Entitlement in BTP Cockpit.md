## Activation Process

As part of the activation process for SAP Joule for Consultants (J4C) capabilities, the setup should be done in a <b><i>standalone/dedicated subaccount</i></b> independent of Joule for Business, e.g., Joule with SAP SuccessFactors or Joule with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, etc...


## Check Service Entitlement

To validate the service entitlements, you can log in to your SAP BTP Global Account, navigate to <b>Entitlements</b>, and then click on <b>Service Assignments</b>.

If both the above services are found, we are good to get started.

**Note**: SAP Joule for Consultants services is currently supported only in EU10 and EU11 Data Centers, and for Joule supported Data Centers, you can click <a href="https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/4538/4826/">here</a>.  

## Entitlements Not Found

In case the Entitlements are not found in your SAP BTP Global Account, and if the order is processed, it could be that you have Multiple SAP BTP Global Accounts, and the license could have been assigned to the other account. Please reach the SAP BTP CSM or AE for support.
