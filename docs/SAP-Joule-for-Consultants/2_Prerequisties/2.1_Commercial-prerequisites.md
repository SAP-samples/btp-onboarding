**SAP Joule for Consulting Capabilities - prerequisites:**

As a customer or partner, you will need to have the following license tagged to your SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) Global Account:

<li>SAP AI Unit SKU (8019164) must be purchased

If you are currently in the ordering process or have not purchased SAP AI Units, we recommend talking to your SAP Account Executive or sales rep for help with the commercial contracts. 

**Important:** If you have multiple SAP BTP Global Accounts, we recommend picking the one Global Account that can be used for all Joule activations, e.g. for Joule for Business, Joule for Consultants, Joule for Developers, etc. Ideally you choose an account with CPEA/BTPEA licenses tagged.  

Once the above SAP AI Units are purchased, you should be able to see the entitlements below in your SAP BTP Global Account:

<li>Joule (technical name: das-Application)</li>
<li>SAP Joule for Consultants (technical name: sap-consulting-capability)</li> 

<br>In order to activate the services, we will need administrative access to the following:</br>

<li>SAP Business Technology Platform - Global Administrator</li>
<li>SAP Cloud Identity Services - Administrator</li>
<li>SAP for Me access with Cloud Administrator role</li>
