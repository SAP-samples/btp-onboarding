Before you can activate Joule, there are certain number of prerequisites that must be met. This section describes those prerequisites and outlines some details that need to be captured prior to running through the activation steps. 

<b>1. User Personas Required for Joule activation</b>

Activation of Joule requires configuration in multiple systems. It's important to have the right stakeholders involved when setting up the configuration. To set up Joule, the following user personas are required: 

<li>You must have the SAP Datasphere application tenant administrator role</li>
<li>Have the role of DW Joule Consumer or a global role that has the Joule privilege (not a scoped role) to use Joule features (this will show up in your SAP Datasphere once Joule is integrated)</li> 
<li>SAP Cloud Identity Services access as an administrator</li>
<li>SAP Business Technology Platform administrator</li>
