## Enterprise Accounts and Commercial Models 

SAP offers two commercial models for BTP enterprise accounts: 
- **Consumption-based commercial model** in the flavors
    - Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement (CPEA)
    - Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)
- **Subscription-based commercial model**. 

<br>

The consumption-based models **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)** and **Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement (CPEA)** offer, in addition, **Free Tier Service Plans**. 
This provides you an easy way to trial certain SAP services within your enterprise account, free of charge to see if they can meet your needs. 
If your proof of concept proves successful, you can seamlessly update from the free model to the paid model without having to redo any of your work.

**Note:** Free Tier Service Plans are not available for all services and all regions.
