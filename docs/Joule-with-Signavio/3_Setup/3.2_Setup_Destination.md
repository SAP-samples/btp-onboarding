## 4. Creating SAP Signavio Destination in the SAP BTP Subaccount

To complete the setup, we need to set up two more destinations - **SIGNAVIO_WZ_CONFIG** and **SIGNAVIO_WZ_RUNTIME** to use the navigation service. 

<b>
Note: SAP Build Work Zone integration will be released soon and will be automated soon; however, it is a manual setup with this release and we use the destination names to sync with next releases. 
</b>

### 4.1 Activate Destination Service and Create a Service Key

To create the destination service, we will need to activate services called Destination Service in your SAP BTP Subaccount. Navigate to our Joule subaccount, click on Services -> click on Service Marketplace - > look for a service called Destination Service -> and click dots and click Create.

In the new pop-up screen, you will be able to see the default values that will be picked up based on your setup. In my case, it’s using Cloud Foundry and the Space from the previous setup and you have to give the Instance Name and click on Create.

Once the instance is created you should be able to see the details in the Instance and Subscription section under Instances.

Click on the three-dots icon for your cli-signavio instance, select Create Service Key, enter the details as shown below, and click on Create.

Once the Service Key is created download this file. You can click either view or download the file as we need the values to create the destinations. We will need the ClientID, Client Secret, URL, and the URI from this file.

### 4.2 Create Destinations
