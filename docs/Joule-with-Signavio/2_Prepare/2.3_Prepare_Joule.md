## 2.3 Preparing for Joule Integration

Once you have the SAP Signavio system ready, please ensure you align with the Unified Cross User Experience approach. Then, plan to either use an existing SAP BTP Subaccount or create a new one only if this is your organization's first project. It should be one Joule for all your SAP applications.

### Case 1: 

If your organization already has an active Joule setup and using the same SAP Cloud Identity Services, then you can skip this step and proceed to the next step to add the SAP Signavio system to the existing formations.

### Case 2: 

If you are doing the Joule setup for the very first time in your organization, then please follow the below instructions to create your SAP BTP Subaccount and run the Joule Booster.

- Go to [Establish a Unified Joule Instance](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/missiondetail/4538/?tab=overview) DC Mission. 
- Login to the system and click on **Project Board**. 
- Under Setup tab, follow the steps given in the below mentioned tiles. Once completed, continue this mission.
    - **Configure Subaccount in SAP BTP for Joule**
    - **Establish Trust between Subaccount and SAP Cloud Identity Authentication Service**
    - **Create SAP Build Work Zone Instance** (In the current release of Joule with SAP Signavio, you may skip this step related to SAP Build Work Zone, as they are not required.)
