## Check your Entitlements for the Global Account

When you purchase an enterprise account, you are entitled to use a specific set of resources, such as the amount of memory that can be allocated to your applications. In a Consumption or PAYG Account, you have access to pretty much all the services that are available with an unlimited quota, in case you are on a subscription model, you will be able to see the services and their limits based on your license model. 

An **entitlement** is your right to provision and consumes a resource. In other words, entitlements are the **service plans** that you're entitled to use.

A **quota** represents the numeric quantity that defines the maximum allowed consumption of a resource. In other words, how much of a service plan you're entitled to use (limits).

**SAP BTP Services** can be business services or technical services. You find all available services and solutions in the SAP Discovery Center.

The figure shows an example of available services in a global account CPEA Model:
