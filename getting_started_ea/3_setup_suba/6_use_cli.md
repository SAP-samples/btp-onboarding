## Account Administration Using the SAP BTP Command Line Interface

The SAP BTP command-line interface (BTP CLI) can be used for all account administration tasks, such as creating or updating subaccounts, authorization management, and working with service brokers and platforms. 
It is an alternative to the SAP BTP cockpit for all users who prefer to work in a terminal or want to automate operations using scripts.
