## Delete a Subaccount

If you want to delete your subaccount, e.g. because it was a test or sandbox subaccount, you can delete unused subaccounts.

**Note:** To prevent accidental deletion of subaccounts and the creation of orphaned data, any active subscriptions, service instances, brokers, or platforms must be removed from the subaccount before they can be deleted. Only subaccount administrators can remove such content from a subaccount.

3. The subaccount doesn't contain any active subscriptions, service instances, brokers, or platforms.
